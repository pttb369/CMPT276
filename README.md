Event Manager Android Application - Introduction to Software Engineering - SFU Academic Project

This was on of my first major projects at SFU. This project was done with three other team members and like my Web Systems Architecture course, we also implemented the Agile Methodology.

This project was an android app which allowed users to create events and invite other users. Some of the tools we used here was Android Studio, Java, and Google Maps API.
