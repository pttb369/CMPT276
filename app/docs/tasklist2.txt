Scrum Master: David Li

Lance Hannestad: made bluetooth sharing, and debugged, and event editing

Gener Iglesias: made login activity and locale translations

Nathan Dhami: made the wifip2p Activity

David Li: made the database adapter and edit activity

For this iteration, everyone helped out with the other tasks as well. However, we were unable to get
the sharing to work using wifi direct p2p. Also, since we don't have a live server, we were unable
to store events when logged in.

We couldn't get wifi direct p2p to work, so we tried with bluetooth. We're sharing a text file
containing event information over bluetooth, and then loading it into the receiving app upon next
using the app. All this is done automatically by the app. To share a spontaneous event over bluetooth
you must not be logged in.
